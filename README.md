## GUI Application Overview

This document describes the deviceWizard Graphical User Interface (GUI) Application.  The GUI is a Web Application which is first installed and then runs on the server. the application provides a convenient way to perform setup and demonstrate device registration features from within a standard Web application environment.
### Features

A separate, tabbed dialogue type interface supports board setup operations. The device demonstrates list of properties (with validation feed back) with dropdown menus, edit boxes and date table as the registration control. The registered devices Panel demonstrates a  selection control with the name of devices to filter and a table to present a list of already existing of this type of device in a table.

###  DeviceWizard Menus

This menu provides the usual {register , Open..., } options. In this application you use this menu and the associated Dialogs to register and modify IoT devices. Example; Assuming that you have registered the desired device type into application in the GUI, you can use the register menu to save the data to the platform. When you again run the GUI you can use the registered device to retrieve the already existing data to the GUI.
